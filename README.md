# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions Using Machine Learning

The main aim of the project is to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. This model will enhance security, improve detection accuracy, and enable real-time assessments to protect against fraud. Ultimately, the project seeks to build trust in financial systems by ensuring robust fraud detection measures.


# Objectives:

Build a robust machine learning model to detect fraudulent activities based on customer and transaction attributes.
Host the model using a Flask API for easy integration with the bank’s decision-making system.
Ensure that the model can process incoming data in real-time and return predictions for fraud likelihood.
Improve the bank’s decision-making process by providing accurate and timely fraud risk assessments

# Data Source:

We sourced our data from Kaggle. Link below:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022

# Question: 
Are there any privacy or regulatory concerns when using this data for fraud detection?
What performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) should be prioritized in evaluating the model?


Key Steps in the Project:

# Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize/Standardize data for better model performance.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
# Feature Engineering:
Analyze correlations between features and fraud detection.
Create new features if necessary (e.g., interaction terms or aggregation features like session frequency).
Use dimensionality reduction techniques to handle the complexity of data.

# Model Building:
Apply various machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) using Scikit-Learn.
Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters.
Evaluate models using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

# Deep Learning (Optional):
Explore the use of deep learning with TensorFlow for potentially more accurate fraud detection models.

# Model Evaluation:
Compare performance across different models to select the best performing one.
Ensure that the model does not overfit by using cross-validation and testing on unseen data.

# Model Deployment:
Build a Flask API to host the model.
The API will accept new transaction data and return predictions on whether it is fraudulent or not.

# Technologies and tools:
Python: For data manipulation, machine learning, and model deployment.

# Pandas:
 For data analysis and preprocessing.

# Scikit-Learn: 
To build and evaluate machine learning models.

# TensorFlow:
 For potential deep learning model development.

# Flask: 
To build the API that will host the model.

# GitHub: 
For version control and collaboration.

# Expected Deliverables:
A trained and evaluated machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions.
A Flask API that can host the model and process real-time fraud detection requests.
A detailed report documenting model performance and how it can be integrated into the bank’s decision-making process.
GitHub repository containing the code for the entire project, including data preprocessing, model training, and API development.
